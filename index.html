   <h1>MDN Course Work</h1>
   <p>This website is my "sandbox" for the work I do while studying the resources in the Mozilla Developer Network <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">learning area.</a></p>

   <h2>Scope</h2>
   <p>I will attempt to only use technologies included in the course. I have learned a lot through my studies at BYU - Idaho, North Idaho College, and other self-study resources; but, I will try not to include any of that. My goal is to stay hyper-focused on this course and stick through it until it is finsihed. I will incorperate additional technologies as they are addressed by MDN's guide. Sadly, this includes excluding CSS styling until I reach that point in the guide. Sigh.</p>

   <h2>Objective</h2>
   <p>In embarking on this study sprint, I hope to finally solidify my foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, I can move onto incorporating more advanced technologies and tools such as server-side programming, client-server structures, backend programming, etc which will allow me to build full-stack apps.</p>
